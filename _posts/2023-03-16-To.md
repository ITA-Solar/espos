## Abstract
Composition of plasma in the solar corona is a tracer of the flow of plasma and energy from the solar interior. A complete understanding of coronal abundances not only provides us another perspective to look at complex processes such as wave propagation, wave absorption, convection, reconnection, and reconfiguration of magnetic fields and coronal heating, but it also has significant implications for solar-like stars. The method to parameterise and study coronal elemental abundances, is to use the first ionisation potential (FIP) bias, defined as taking the ratio of an elementâ€™s coronal to photospheric abundance with respect to H. In this seminar, we introduce FIP bias as a proxy to understand processes in different solar structures, ranging from small brightenings to active regions, using a wide range of techniques such as extreme-ultraviolet and radio imaging, and spectroscopy to study to the evolution of these solar structures, and interpret the physical processes underneath.
