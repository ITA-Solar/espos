## Abstract
Deep learning has emerged as a very powerful set of techniques to
extract relevant information from observations, sometimes showing
much better results that other set of finely tuned algorithms. In this
contribution I present our efforts in applying deep learning to
several problems in Solar Physics, from the estimation of horizontal
velocities in the solar surface to fast image reconstruction.
