## Abstract
A new era of solar physics commences with observations of the quiet Sun using the 4-metre Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope/Visible Spectropolarimeter (DKIST/ViSP). We present full-Stokes observations taken during DKISTâ€™s cycle 1, in the Fe I 630.1/630.2 nm lines, allowing us to examine small-scale magnetism in the photosphere. We use the Stokes Inversion based on Response functions (SIR) code to invert the Fe I line pair. We reveal the existence of a serpentine magnetic element for the first time. A statistical analysis is undertaken, comparing inversions of DKIST data with Hinode data. A novel machine learning technique is used to characterise and contrast the shapes of circular polarisation signals found in the ground-based and space-based data, and synthetic observations produced from MANCHA simulations are used to aid our understanding of the differences between datasets.
