## Abstract
In the recent decades, three-dimensional modelling of solar flares and eruptions has made a number of predictions that were subsequently indicated by high-resolution imaging observations. These include existence of magnetic reconnection geometries involving the erupting flux rope itself, which drifts as a result, and also the apparent slipping and slip-running motion of footpoints of individual reconnecting structures. In this talk, we will summarize the predictions of the MHD models as well as the corroborating evidence, with particular emphasis on recent observations of super-Alfvénic slippage of flare kernels.
