## Abstract
On 26 September 2022, we observed a quiescent solar prominence with Hα imaging spectroscopy using the Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager (SDDI) on the SMART telescope. Unlike earlier works that detected 4- and 15-min oscillations through long-slit, 1D wavelet methods, we adapt the wavelet analysis to 3D data to explore the full prominence structure. Complementary data from SDO/AIA (304 Å, 171 Å) STEREO-A/EUVI (304 Å), and Solar Orbiter EUI/FSI (304 Å, 174 Å) enable a multi-view, multi-thermal investigation of wave periodicity across the prominence. Our aim is to characterize how oscillatory periods are distributed in plasma at different temperatures and viewing angles, thereby assessing wave propagation and variability throughout the prominence body.
