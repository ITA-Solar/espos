## Abstract
Sustained kink oscillations in coronal loops have long been observed in TRACE, SDO/AIA, and more recently in SolO/EUI images. Although their properties are quite well-known now, their driver and excitation mechanism remain under active debate. In this talk I will give an overview over the different ideas/theories that discuss the role of photospheric driving in the generation of kink oscillations. We exploited an unique dataset of high-resolution coronal and photospheric observations taken recently by SolO/EUI/HRI and the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) respectively during a dedicated coordinated campaign run in October 2023. Using the SST/CRISP data we estimated and quantified the strength of photospheric driving at the footpoints of active region coronal loops, that include pore, plage, enhanced-network and sunspot regions. We then looked at kink oscillation signatures in the same coronal loops within the EUI/HRI coronal images. An attempt was then made to link the photospheric and coronal results together. I will finally discuss the implications of this work on the driving and excitation mechanism of kink oscillations, and future perspectives.
