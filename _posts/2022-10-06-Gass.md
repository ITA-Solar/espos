## Abstract
The Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of NASAâ€™s Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has been providing near uninterrupted coverage of the solar atmosphere since its launch on February 11, 2010, with full coverage of Solar Cycle 24, and ongoing coverage of Cycle 25. With a pixel resolution of 0.6 arcsec and full sun field of view in a time cadence of 12s in multiple EUV bands, this extensive data catalogue has captured a wide array of solar atmospheric phenomenon and can provide information as to how these change with the solar magnetic cycle. This presentation outlines the benefits and challenges involved in approaching such a wide dataset, with an example of how automated detection of events and structures can provide a wealth of large number statistics of direct importance to the study of coronal structures in particular.
