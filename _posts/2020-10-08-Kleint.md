## Abstract
GREGOR is Europe's largest solar telescope. It has undergone significant upgrades and changes from 2018-2020 to improve the image quality, instrumentation, and operation. Particularly, a complete redesign of the optics laboratory was performed by KIS to obtain diffraction-limited images from the blue to the infrared. The new optics setup was completed while "trapped" on the mountain during the lockdown and we obtained first light images in July 2020. In this talk, I will summarize the most important updates, explain the new optics setup, and show the improved images.
