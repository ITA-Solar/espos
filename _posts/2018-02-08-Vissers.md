## Abstract
Ellerman bombs and UV bursts are transient brightenings that are ubiquitously
observed in the lower atmospheres of active and emerging flux regions. While
some Ellerman bombs display clear UV burst signatures, not all have correlated
UV signal or vice versa, suggesting the underlying atmospheric and magnetic
properties may differ between events. As both are believed to pinpoint sites of
magnetic reconnection in reconfiguring fields, understanding their occurrence
and detailed evolution may provide helpful insights in the overall evolution of
active regions. Here we present results from observations and inversions of
SST/CRISP and CHROMIS, as well as IRIS data of these transient events. At
unprecedented spatial resolution the CHROMIS Ca II H & K observations reveal
dynamic fine structure suggesting a plasmoid-mediated reconnection process. We
investigate several cases, combining information from the Mg II h & k and Ca II
8542Ã… and H & K lines in order to infer the temperature stratification and
magnetic field configuration within which these events occur. I'll address the
difficulties of successfully inverting their Si IV profiles and will discuss our
results in light of the current debate on the connection between UV bursts and
Ellerman bombs, their occurrence heights and in particular the temperatures that
they may (or may not) reach.
