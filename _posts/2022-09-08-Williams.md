## Abstract
NASA’s Sounding Rocket Program has provided essential contributions to space science since 1959 and has proved to be one of the most robust, versatile, and cost-effective flight programs at NASA. On the 29th May 2018, the High-resolution Coronal Imager (Hi-C) was launched for a third time from the White Sands Missile Range, NM, USA capturing 329 seconds of 17.2 nm data of target active region AR 12712, with a cadence of ~4s and a plate scale of ~0.129 arcsec. This unique dataset provides some of the highest-resolution EUV observations of coronal loops to date. In this presentation, the spatial scales of these fundamental building blocks of the solar corona are explored and the results from Hi-C are discussed with respect to SDO/AIA and Solar Orbiter.
