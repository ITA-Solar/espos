## Abstract
We study the dynamics of plasma along the legs of an arch filament system (AFS) observed with relatively high-cadence spectropolarimetric data from the ground-based solar GREGOR telescope (Tenerife) using the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph in the He I 10830 Å range. The temporal evolution of the plasma of an AFS was followed using the chromospheric He I 10830 Å triplet and Si I 10827 Å. Measurements of vector magnetic fields in the solar chromosphere, especially in AFS, are extremely scarce, but very important. The magnetic field configuration reveals how AFSs are sustained in the chromosphere and hints at their formation, evolution, and disappearance. The magnetic field in the AFS follows loop-like structures traced by chromospheric absorption lines. However, if magnetic field lines follow chromospheric threads as seen by filtergrams of H⍺, Ca II, or He I, is still not fully resolved. Previous studies have modeled AFS as multiple flux ropes with mixed signs of helicity consistently with the observed multiple filament bundles constituting AFS. Nevertheless, further spectropolarimetric observations are needed to address this issue. Many spectral lines are sensitive to the atmospheric parameters up to the upper chromosphere. Moreover, when combined with photospheric Zeeman sensitive spectral lines, one can infer the topology of the magnetic field from the bottom of the solar atmosphere to the chromosphere. In this talk, we are going to follow the nature of AFSs by reconstructing the magnetic field configuration of an EFR from the very beginning and follow its evolution and dynamics to support current AFS models. To that aim we used the spectropolarimetric data available at the upper photosphere (Si I) and the upper chromosphere.
