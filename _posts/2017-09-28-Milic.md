## Abstract

In this talk we will focus on diagnostic potential of the spectral region around D lines of Sodium. We will first outline our approach to non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions, and present a method for the computation of response functions in non-LTE. We will then discuss the sensitivity of Sodium D lines to the atmospheric parameters and present some example inversions of that spectral region.
