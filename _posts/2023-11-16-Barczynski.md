## Abstract
Active regions are the most dynamic structures in the solar disk. They contain numerous substructures with wide orders of sizes and lifetimes. The evolution of an active region with different time scales, the role of the small-scale structures in the active region, the mechanism triggering the transient phenomena, and the mechanism responsible for the plasma upflow at the active region border are still open issues. 
The main aim of the project is to focus on these open issues using high-resolution observation of the solar atmosphere obtained from different vantage points. 
The active region was observed during coordinated observations with Solar Orbiter and Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) on 18-21 October and 24 October 2022. Instruments onboard Solar Orbiter and DKIST provide unprecedented high-spatial and temporal simultaneous observation of the active region. Moreover, the Hinode and IRIS also focus on the same active region. We present the preliminary results of the coordinated observations from magnetic field, imaging and spectroscopy instruments.
