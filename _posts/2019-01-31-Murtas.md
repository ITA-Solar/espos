## Abstract
Solar observations offer both a rich interdisciplinary laboratory on fundamental astrophysics and precious tools for Space Weather applications. The involved plasma processes determine a complex radio emission picture that could be efficiently explored through single-dish imaging at high frequencies. In particular, mapping the brightness temperature of the free-free radio emission in the centimetre and millimetre range is an effective tool to characterise the vertical structure of the solar atmosphere.

In this presentation I disclose the continuum imaging of chromosphere and corona in K-band (18-26.5 GHz) performed with the 32-m diameter Medicina Radio Telescope and the 64-m diameter Sardinia Radio Telescope (SRT), as a first scientific demonstration test for the potentialities of Italian single-dish antennas in this field. These observations proved that the antennas and K-band receivers are stable during solar pointing and could provide full mapping of the solar disk in about 1 hour exposure using state-of-the-art imaging techniques. This study will be useful for the assessment of observation parameters aiming at studying in detail the chromospheric brightness temperature of the quiet Sun, the solar flares and the sunspots; in perspective, a contribution will be provided to Space Weather monitoring networks and forecast, filling different gaps that presently exist in the worldwide observing scenario.
