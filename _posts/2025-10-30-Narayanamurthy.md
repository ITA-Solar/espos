## Abstract
In July 2024, Sunrise III flew from Sweden to Canada at stratospheric heights capturing high resolution diffraction-limited images of the Sun for 6.5 days. The telescope carried three scientific instruments each complementing the other by observing in different parts of the solar spectrum from the near-ultraviolet by SUSI (309 nm - 417 nm), the visible by TuMag (517 nm - 525 nm) to the near infrared by SCIP (765 nm - 855 nm). During its flight, Sunrise III observed a wide variety of features on the Sun including the quiet region, sunspots, plages, filaments, spicules, flux emergence, and also flares.  By combining the data from the three instruments, it is possible to infer and understand various properties of the solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the upper chromosphere.  In this talk, I will walk you through the Sunrise III journey, the science planning, present observational highlights and provide a glimpse into some of the exciting ongoing scientific analysis from the Sunrise III data.
