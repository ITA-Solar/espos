## Abstract
Ever since their detection two decades ago, standing kink oscillations in coronal loops have been extensively studied both observationally and theoretically. Almost all driven coronal loop oscillations (e.g., by flares) are observed to damp through time often with Gaussian or exponential profiles. Intriguingly, however, it has been shown theoretically that the amplitudes of some oscillations could be modified from Gaussian or exponential profiles if cooling is present in the coronal loop systems. In this talk, we analyse a flare-driven high-amplitude coronal loop oscillation observed by the SDO/AIA to see if models of cooling can explain the amplitude profile. We also look for hints of cooling in the intensity evolution of several SDO/AIA filters. The application of cooling coronal loop modelling allowed us to estimate a density ratio of 2.05-2.35 between the loop and the background plasma.
