## Abstract
Recent high-resolution simulations of non-magnetic solar photospheric convection suggest the
presence of a separate class of small-scale photospheric brightenings, which coincide with
intergranular vortex tubes. In contrast to well-known magnetic bright points, these brightenings
are not related to magnetic fields. In our presentation, using high-resolution simulations with
MURaM and detailed radiative diagnostics of the simulated models, I will analyse the physical
characteristics of these brightenings and their observability with current and future instruments for solar observations.
