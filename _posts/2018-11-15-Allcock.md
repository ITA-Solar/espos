## Abstract
Are solar MHD waveguides symmetric? It is convenient to assume
that they are. The solar physics community is familiar with the traditional
notion of sausage and kink waves, which propagate along waveguides in the
solar atmosphere that we assume are symmetric. In this talk, we drop this
assumption and motivate the study of MHD wave propagation in asymmetric
waveguides from theoretical and observational viewpoints. We discuss the
implications that asymmetric waveguides have for mode identification,
highlighting the observational ambiguity between waves in symmetric and
asymmetric waveguides, which becomes a crucial consideration when
implementing magneto-seismology diagnostics.

We present a novel technique for solar magneto-seismology that utilises
the observed asymmetry of MHD waves to diagnose background parameters of
the solar atmosphere that are difficult to measure using traditional
methods. We present a preliminary application of this technique to
chromospheric fibrils as a proof-of-concept and discuss the potential
further application to prominences, elongated magnetic bright points, and
sunspot light walls.
