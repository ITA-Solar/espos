## Abstract
The Solar coronal heating problem remains a persistent challenge in astrophysics. Parker postulated back in 1988 that the heating of corona should be dominated by small energy dissipation events, referred to as nanoflares. However, there have not yet been any confirmed observations of individual nanoflares. Hi-C reported unique bright points with energies ranging between log[E(ergs)] = 24-25. Those brightenings were also identified in AIA passbands. Here, I will describe 0-D hydrodynamical simulations to forward model these tiny brightenings, study their energetics, and discuss possible implications for coronal heating.
