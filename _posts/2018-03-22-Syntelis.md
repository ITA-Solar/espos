## Abstract
We report on three-dimensional MHD simulations of recurrent small-scale Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)-like eruptions using flux-emergence simulations and study their formation and eruption mechanism. These eruptions have the size and energies of small prominence eruptions. The erupting flux ropes are formed due to the reconnection of J-loops (formed by shearing and rotation) and are located inside magnetic envelope field favouring torus instability. The flux rope eruptions are triggered by the action of a tension removal mechanism, such as the typical tether-cutting where the envelope field reconnects with itself. Another side tether-cutting is also found. There, the envelope field reconnected with the J-loops. The two tether-cutting mechanisms transfer hot plasma differently inside the erupting structures. We report similar mechanisms creating three more eruptions in a recurrent manner.
