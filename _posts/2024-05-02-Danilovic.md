## Abstract
We present the results of coordinated observations of the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope with Solar Orbiter that took place from October 12th to 26th 2023. The campaign resulted in 7 datasets of various quality. The observational programs were adjusted to the seeing conditions. The observations cover two active regions and a coronal hole. We focus on the morphology and evolution of several targets that are observed from two vantage points. We share the lessons we learned and give an outline of our plans for October this year and the support we could give during remote sensing windows 16 and 17.
