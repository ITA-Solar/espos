## Abstract
With the increase of space EUV observations (SoHO, SDO, Solar Orbiter and soon the Vigil mission), this diagnostic has become an essential tool to bridge the gap between models and our current understanding of coronal phenomena. We will present a review of the recent studies using the Wind Predict model and its different versions, which is a 3-dimension magnetohydrodynamic code to model the solar chromosphere, corona and the expansion of the solar wind. We will in particular discuss the influence of observations on the simulation results (with the question of spatial resolution, as well as the inclusion of far-side active regions observed by Solar Orbiter), and vice-versa how the generation of synthetic data can help us improve our simulations (with the implementation of a feedback loop based on automated coronal hole detection). Finally, we will present the next developments foreseen for the Wind Predict code.
